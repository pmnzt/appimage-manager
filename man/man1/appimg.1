.SH NAME
appimg - manage AppImages
.SH SYNOPSIS
appimg [COMMAND] [APPIMAGE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A script to manage AppImages.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBmove\fR
Move AppImage files into the managed directory (~/.appimages). Each AppImage should end up in its own folder.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg move [OPTIONS] [PATH]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB-s DIR\fR
Specify a directory to search for AppImages.
.TP
\fB--all\fR
Move all AppImages found in the search scope.
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
If ~/.appimages does not exist, create it.
For each AppImage found, create a folder for that AppImage inside ~/.appimages and move the file there.
Do not attempt to move files that are already inside ~/.appimages into the same location.
Do handle ~/.appimages/tmp specially (it may contain reset files) — do not skip it when appropriate, but avoid moving from a folder into itself.
If --all is omitted, the user must provide the AppImage path: appimg move ~/Downloads/myapp.AppImage.
Matching of file extensions is case-insensitive.
.RE
.TP
\fBls\fR
List AppImage files. By default searches the user\'s home directory.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg ls [OPTIONS]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB-s DIR\fR
Specify a directory to search ("s" = search scope).
.PP
\fBOUTPUT:\fR
Prints each found AppImage with its full path.
.RE
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Scan ~/.appimages, and for each folder containing an AppImage generate a .desktop file and ensure a proper icon and executable bit. If APPNAME is provided, only that application is updated.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg update [APPNAME] [--icon|--icon-skip]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB[APPNAME]\fR
Update a specific app.
.TP
\fB--icon\fR / \fB--icon-skip\fR
Control icon extraction.
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
For each folder in ~/.appimages that contains an AppImage:
Generate or update the .desktop file for the application.
Determine the icon using the following precedence:
1. If icon.* already exists in the folder, use it.
2. Otherwise, extract the AppImage and inspect its embedded .desktop Icon key; then try to find a matching icon:
Search common icon directories (e.g. /usr/share/icons, /usr/share/pixmaps) for an SVG matching the name.
If no matching SVG, search for a matching PNG and prefer the largest PNG file by file size.
If still not found, search for a matching XPM.
If no direct match is found, fall back to the largest SVG, then largest PNG, then largest XPM from the extracted contents.
3. If no icon is found at all:
If --icon was provided, automatically attempt to extract icons from the AppImage.
If --icon-skip was provided, do not attempt extraction and use ~/.appimages/placeholder-icon.png.
If neither option is provided, ask the user if they would like to extract icons from the AppImage. If the user declines or no icon can be extracted, use ~/.appimages/placeholder-icon.png.
Copy the chosen icon into the app's folder as icon.*.
Create a .noiconkeep marker if needed to prevent icon copying on reset.
Ensure the AppImage file is executable.
Create a symlink for the generated .desktop file in the system applications directory (e.g. ~/.local/share/applications).
Note: AppImage file extensions are treated case-insensitively.
.RE
.TP
\fBsetup-all\fR
Convenience command that runs appimg move and appimg update with their default options to discover, move, and register AppImages.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg setup-all [--icon|--icon-skip]
.RE
.TP
\fBreset\fR
Reset the managed AppImage state. Move managed AppImages to a temporary area, remove their folders, and undo registration.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg reset
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
Move all AppImage files from their folders in ~/.appimages into ~/.appimages/tmp.
When moving, also move any icons that belong to an AppImage; rename them using the pattern <appname>-icon.* so they can be detected later by appimg update.
After moving files to ~/.appimages/tmp, delete the now-empty app folders.
Mark the moved AppImage files as non-executable.
Remove any symlinks created in the system applications directory.
appimg update should be able to detect icons in ~/.appimages/tmp (using the <appname>-icon.* pattern), rename them to icon.* and move them back to the appropriate folders when restoring.
.RE
.TP
\fBselect\fR
Manage and switch between multiple versions of an AppImage for a given application name.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg select <appname>
.B appimg select <appname> \-\-switch <VERSION>
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
.TP
\fBVersion Naming Convention\fR
When \fBappimg move\fR processes AppImages, if multiple versions of the same application (basically when there\'s more than one appimage of the same name) are detected, it appends a unique #version\-string suffix to the filename (e.g., krita#1.AppImage, krita#2.AppImage). The # character denotes the start of the version string for identification purposes across commands.
.TP
\fBStorage Location\fR
All versions of a single application are stored within the same dedicated subfolder under \fB~/.appimages\fR (e.g., \fB~/.appimages/krita/krita#1.AppImage\fR).
.TP
\fBActive Version Symlink\fR
A symlink, named after the application without a version suffix (e.g., \fB~/.appimages/krita/krita.AppImage\fR), points to the currently active version. This symlink is the target for .desktop file entries and system integration.
.TP
\fBappimg select <appname>
Lists all available versioned AppImages (e.g., krita#1.AppImage, krita#3.AppImage) found in the application\'s folder and indicates which version the active symlink currently points to.
.TP
\fBappimg select <appname> \-\-switch <VERSION>
Modifies the active symlink (e.g., \fB~/.appimages/krita/krita.AppImage\fR) to point to the AppImage file corresponding to <VERSION>. Subsequently, \fBappimg update <appname>\fR is automatically run to re\-generate the .desktop file and ensure system integration reflects the new active version.
.TP
\fBInteractions with other commands\fR
.RS
.PP
\fBappimg move\fR: Recognizes the # character as a version separator and ensures multiple versions of an application are grouped within the same folder.
.PP
\fBappimg reset\fR: Removes the active version symlink (e.g., krita.AppImage) when moving AppImages to \fB~/.appimages/tmp\fR. The version string (e.g., #1) is preserved in the AppImage filename during this move.
.RE

\fBversion\fR, \fB-v\fR
