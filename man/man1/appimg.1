.SH NAME
appimg - manage AppImages
.SH SYNOPSIS
appimg [COMMAND] [APPIMAGE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A script to manage, organize, and register AppImage files under ~/.appimages.

AppImages are categorized into:
.RS
.TP
.B managed/
Contains AppImages that have been registered by appimg. Each app has its own folder named after its desktop-file ID, containing the AppImage, its .desktop file, and its icon.
.TP
.B unmanaged/
Contains newly discovered or reset AppImages.
.RE

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBmove\fR
Move AppImage files into the managed directory (~/.appimages/managed). Each AppImage is placed in its own folder based on its application ID.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg move [OPTIONS] [PATH]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB-s DIR\fR
Specify a directory to search for AppImages.
.TP
\fB--all\fR
Move all AppImages found in the search scope (defaults to $HOME if PATH is omitted).
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
Create ~/.appimages, managed/, and unmanaged/ if missing.
.br
Extract the embedded .desktop file from each AppImage to determine its application ID.
.br
Create ~/.appimages/managed/<APPID>/ and move the AppImage into it.
.br
Rename the AppImage to: <APPID>.AppImage.
.br
Overwrite any existing AppImage for the same ID (only one version is managed at a time).
.br
Skip AppImages already inside managed/ to avoid pointless moves.
.br
If --all is not used, PATH must be provided.
.br
File extension matching is case-insensitive (.AppImage / .appimage).
.RE
.TP
\fBls\fR
List AppImage files. By default searches the user’s home directory.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg ls [OPTIONS]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB-s DIR\fR
Specify the directory to search ("s" = search scope).
.PP
\fBOUTPUT:\fR
Prints full paths to all detected AppImages.
.RE
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Generate or update .desktop files, icons, and symlinks for managed AppImages. If APPNAME is provided, only that application is updated.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg update [APPNAME]
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
Scan ~/.appimages/managed/ for application folders.
.br
For each folder containing an AppImage:
.RS
.IP • 2
Generate/update <APPID>.desktop inside the folder.
.IP •
Determine the icon using the following precedence:
.RS
1. If icon.* exists in the folder, use it.
.br
2. Otherwise extract the AppImage and attempt to locate an icon based on the embedded .desktop Icon key:
.RS
• Search usr/share/icons and usr/share/pixmaps for a matching SVG (case-insensitive).
.br
• If none, search for matching PNG and choose the largest PNG.
.br
• If none, search for matching XPM.
.RE
If no icon matching the Icon key is found:
.RS
• Fall back to largest SVG in extracted contents.
.br
• Otherwise largest PNG.
.br
• Otherwise largest XPM.
.RE
3. If no icon is found at all, use ~/.appimages/placeholder-icon.png.
.RE
.IP •
Copy the chosen icon into the folder as icon.<ext>.
.IP •
If the icon was extracted, create a .noiconkeep marker (not created for custom icons).
.IP •
Ensure the AppImage binary is executable.
.IP •
Create/update a symlink in ~/.local/share/applications/ pointing to the .desktop file.
.RE
Note: AppImage file extensions are matched case-insensitively.
.RE
.TP
\fBsetup-all\fR
Run appimg move --all and appimg update to fully scan, organize, and register all AppImages.
