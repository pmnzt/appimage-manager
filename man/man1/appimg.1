.SH NAME
appimg - manage AppImages
.SH SYNOPSIS
appimg [COMMAND] [APPIMAGE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A script to manage AppImages.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBmove\fR
Move AppImage files into the managed directory (~/.appimages). Each AppImage should end up in its own folder.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg move [OPTIONS] [PATH]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB-s DIR\fR
Specify a directory to search for AppImages.
.TP
\fB--all\fR
Move all AppImages found in the search scope.
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
For each AppImage, extract its embedded .desktop file to determine the application's ID.
Create a folder named after the ID inside ~/.appimages and move the AppImage there.
The AppImage should be renamed to match the folder name (e.g., ~/.appimages/com.appname.App/com.appname.App.AppImage).
This process overwrites any existing AppImage, meaning there is only one version of each application at a time.
Do not attempt to move files that are already inside ~/.appimages into the same location.
Do handle ~/.appimages/tmp specially (it may contain reset files) — do not skip it when appropriate, but avoid moving from a folder into itself.
If --all is omitted, the user must provide the AppImage path: appimg move ~/Downloads/myapp.AppImage.
Matching of file extensions is case-insensitive.
.RE
.TP
\fBls\fR
List AppImage files. By default searches the user\'s home directory.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg ls [OPTIONS]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB-s DIR\fR
Specify a directory to search ("s" = search scope).
.PP
\fBOUTPUT:\fR
Prints each found AppImage with its full path.
.RE
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Scan ~/.appimages, and for each folder containing an AppImage generate a .desktop file and ensure a proper icon and executable bit. If APPNAME is provided, only that application is updated.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg update [APPNAME]
.PP
\fBOPTIONS:\fR
.TP
\fB[APPNAME]\fR
Update a specific app.
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
For each folder in ~/.appimages that contains an AppImage:
Generate or update the .desktop file for the application.
Determine the icon using the following precedence:
1. If icon.* already exists in the folder, use it.
2. Otherwise, extract the AppImage and inspect its embedded .desktop Icon key; then try to find a matching icon:
Search common icon directories (e.g. /usr/share/icons, /usr/share/pixmaps) for an SVG matching the name.
If no matching SVG, search for a matching PNG and prefer the largest PNG file by file size.
If still not found, search for a matching XPM.
If no direct match is found, fall back to the largest SVG, then largest PNG, then largest XPM from the extracted contents.
3. If no icon is found at all, use ~/.appimages/placeholder-icon.png.
Copy the chosen icon into the app's folder as icon.*.
Create a .noiconkeep marker if needed to prevent icon copying on reset.
Ensure the AppImage file is executable.
Create a symlink for the generated .desktop file in the system applications directory (e.g. ~/.local/share/applications).
Note: AppImage file extensions are treated case-insensitively.
.RE
.TP
\fBsetup-all\fR
Convenience command that runs appimg move and appimg update with their default options to discover, move, and register AppImages.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg setup-all
.RE
.TP
\fBreset\fR
Reset the managed AppImage state. Move managed AppImages to a temporary area, remove their folders, and undo registration.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
.B appimg reset
.PP
\fBBEHAVIOR:\fR
Move all AppImage files from their folders in ~/.appimages into ~/.appimages/tmp.
When moving, also move any icons that belong to an AppImage; rename them using the pattern <appname>-icon.* so they can be detected later by appimg update.
After moving files to ~/.appimages/tmp, delete the now-empty app folders.
Mark the moved AppImage files as non-executable.
Remove any symlinks created in the system applications directory.
appimg update should be able to detect icons in ~/.appimages/tmp (using the <appname>-icon.* pattern), rename them to icon.* and move them back to the appropriate folders when restoring.
.RE
.TP
\fBversion\fR, \fB-v\fR
Print the appimg version.
.RS
.PP
\fBUSAGE:\fR
